            <p>
                The technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software.
            </p>
            <p>MERN stack is a web development framework. It consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS as its working components.</p>
            <p>MERN stack is a combination of the above technologies, all based on JavaScript, used to build advanced web applications. It is an open source full stack development framework i.e. it provides entire front-end to back-end development components. While MongoDB, Express JS and Node JS are the common components (between MEAN and MERN); Angular JS is replaced by React JS in MERN.</p>

                    <h2>MongoDB</h2>
                    <p>MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL)..</p>

                    <h2>Express</h2>
                    <p>
                        Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.[3] It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.[4]

                        The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server,[5] meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the back-end component of the MEAN stack, together with the MongoDB database software and AngularJS front-end framework.

                    <h2>React</h2>
                    <p>
                        React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.

                        Node.js is an open source server environment
                        Node.js is free
                        Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
                        Node.js uses JavaScript on the server
                        Node.js can generate dynamic page content
                        Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
                        Node.js can collect form data
                        Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database
